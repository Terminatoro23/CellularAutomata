# CellularAutomata
The program uses the matplotlib and NumPy libraries. Takes a number (between 0-255) from the user, then converts it to a binary number. 
Each subsequent step is calculated on the basis of three consecutive numbers. 
Their value (converted to a number in the decimal system) indicates the place from which we need to get the number from the initial table.
We put the downloaded value in a place appropriate for a given step.
The result of the calculation is shown in the form of a picture.

An exemplary program result for 300 steps and counting for the number 90:
